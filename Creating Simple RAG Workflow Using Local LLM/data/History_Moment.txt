The siege of Constantinople began on April 6, 1453, when the Ottoman Empire, led by the 21-year-old Sultan Mehmed II, positioned a massive army of approximately 80,000 to 100,000 soldiers outside the city walls. 
Defending the Byzantine capital was Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos, who commanded a significantly smaller force of roughly 7,000 to 10,000 men. 
The city was protected by the legendary Theodosian Walls, which had remained largely unconquered for over a thousand years. 
To breach these fortifications, the Ottomans employed a revolutionary weapon: a massive cannon designed by Orban that could fire 600-pound stone balls. 
While the Byzantines used a giant iron chain to block the Golden Horn, Mehmed II executed a brilliant tactical maneuver by transporting his ships overland on greased logs to bypass the barrier. 
By April 22, the Ottoman fleet was successfully positioned in the harbor, creating a dual threat for the defenders. 
Despite the constant bombardment, the city’s inhabitants worked tirelessly to repair the walls under the cover of night. 
As the siege dragged on into late May, Sultan Mehmed II decided to launch a final, decisive assault to break the stalemate. 
This final attack commenced in the early hours of May 29, 1453, targeting the weakened sections of the walls. 
During the intense fighting, the elite Ottoman Janissaries discovered a small open gate known as the Kerkoporta, which allowed them to enter the city. 
The defense further collapsed when the Genoese commander, Giovanni Giustiniani, was wounded and forced to leave the battlefield.
Emperor Constantine XI is said to have died heroically in the street fighting, marking the symbolic end of the Byzantine lineage. 
By the afternoon of that day, the Ottoman flag was hoisted over the city, signaling a new era in world history. 
This conquest resulted in the definitive end of the Roman Empire, which had endured for nearly 1,500 years. 
The event also triggered a migration of Greek scholars to Italy, which played a crucial role in fueling the European Renaissance. 
Furthermore, the fall of the city forced European powers to seek new trade routes, eventually leading to the Age of Discovery. 
Today, the event remains one of the most significant milestones in military and political history. 
Following the victory, the city was transformed into Istanbul, serving as the powerful capital of the Ottoman Empire for centuries to come.
