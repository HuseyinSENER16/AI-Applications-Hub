## Overview
The AI Applications Hub is a repository of AI projects and implementations that are designed to be deployed locally and prioritize privacy. Each project is self-contained and can be run independently.

## Local Deployment
All AI applications in this repository are designed to be deployed locally, ensuring that data remains on your device and is not sent to remote servers. This approach enhances privacy and security by minimizing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access.

## Privacy Considerations
The AI Applications Hub prioritizes privacy and security by:
- Implementing local deployment to ensure data remains on your device.
- Using open-source AI models and frameworks to reduce dependency on third-party services.
- Providing clear documentation and examples to help users understand how to implement and use AI applications locally.

## Contributing
Contributions to the AI Applications Hub are welcome! If you have an AI application that you would like to add to the repository, please follow these guidelines:
- Ensure that the application is designed to be deployed locally.
- Follow the same coding standards and documentation format as the existing applications.
- Submit a pull request with your changes.
